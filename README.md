# DarkMoon Grading
#### Video Demo:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cEZMz6Iv24>
#### Description:

The program I created is a grading application that students, teachers, and gaurdians can use. From the teacher view it includes a grading system that automatically calculates and updates grades. You can also add students and classes. From any other view you are able to see the student's grades and classes. Also, thanks to bootstrap and W3Schools for their html styling help and courier for their emailing service which allowed me to style emails.
